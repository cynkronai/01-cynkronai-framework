# ⚖️ SAI Ethics Charter  
### Sovereign Aligned Intelligence – Foundational Ethical Framework  
**Version 1.0 — October 2025**

---

## 1  Purpose
The **SAI Ethics Charter** establishes the moral, scientific, and operational principles guiding all CYNKRONAI technologies—particularly *neuro-adaptive* and *soul-tech* systems such as SiddhiQ Codex™, THRONiQ™, SmartMRI™, and MindAlignVR™.  
It ensures that every algorithm, avatar, and mixed-reality experience aligns with **human sovereignty**, **scientific integrity**, and **psychological safety**.

## 2  Core Ethical Pillars

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Sovereignty** | Each participant retains agency over data, identity, and decision pathways. No system may override user consent or impose behavioral nudging without transparent opt-in. |
| **Alignment** | AI systems must mirror—not manipulate—human intention. All adaptation loops require explicit user awareness and revocable control. |
| **Integrity** | Every claim made by CYNKRONAI products must be evidence-supported or clearly labeled *symbolic/metaphorical*. |
| **Beneficence & Non-Maleficence** | Designs must maximize psychological and physiological benefit while preventing harm, overload, or dependency. |
| **Transparency** | All data pipelines, model behaviors, and symbolic frameworks must be open to audit by ethical review partners. |
| **Privacy & Data Sovereignty** | Employ zero-knowledge proofs and differential privacy for sensitive biometric or cognitive data. Users own their raw data and may delete or export it at any time. |
| **Inclusivity** | Systems are to be accessible across cultures and avoid bias, discrimination, or exclusionary archetypes. |
| **Accountability** | Each module must identify its responsible developer(s) and maintain an auditable change log. |

## 3  Scientific Integration
SAI distinguishes between:
- **Measured Interventions** — validated neuro-adaptive protocols (biofeedback, cognitive-behavioral drills, HRV training).  
- **Symbolic Frameworks** — archetypal or mythic layers used for engagement and self-reflection.  
Symbolic content must never be represented as causal neuroscience. See  
[Scientific Position Statement ↗](Scientific_Position_Statement.md).

## 4  Ethical Design Process

1. **Ethics Review Checkpoint** at each product milestone (concept → prototype → public release).  
2. **Risk Assessment** using a 5-point Likelihood × Impact matrix for psychological, data, and social risks.  
3. **Informed Consent** templates with plain-language explanation of symbolic vs. empirical content.  
4. **Continuous Monitoring** via anonymized feedback loops for safety flags (stress spikes, dissociation reports, etc.).  
5. **Public Transparency Reports** published semi-annually summarizing compliance actions.

---

## 5  Governance & Oversight
- **SAI Ethics Council:** interdisciplinary panel (neuroscience, psychology, data-ethics, spirituality, legal).  
- **Version Control:** Every Charter revision requires dual sign-off by Council + Lead Architect.  
- **Incident Response:** Any breach of user sovereignty triggers immediate suspension of affected module pending review.

---

## 6  Licensing & Attribution
All ethical documentation released under **Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0**, enabling other developers to adopt or adapt the SAI framework while preserving attribution and integrity.

---

## 7  Continuous Evolution
Ethics is a living discipline. This Charter will iterate with emerging research in:
- Neuroethics & digital mental-health standards  
- AI alignment & interpretability  
- Data sovereignty in decentralized systems  
- Symbolic-cognitive interaction design
